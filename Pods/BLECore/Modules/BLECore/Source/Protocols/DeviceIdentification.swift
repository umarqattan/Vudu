/**
 The `DeviceIdentification` protocol provides the information necessary to identify a particular device type based upon its advertised services, its advertisement data, and the services a peripheral provides.

 ### Matching Algorithm

 The union of the `requiredAdvertisedServiceUUIDs` across all `Device` types registered in the `BluetoothManager` is passed as the `serviceUUIDs` argument to `CBCentralManager.scanForPeripherals(withServices:options:)`.

 When devices are discovered, the list of registered `Device` types is queried. To be considered a match, the following must be true of a discovered peripheral in order for it to be converted to a `DiscoveredDevice` and emitted as a `DiscoveryEvent`:

 - The advertised service UUIDs contained in the advertisement data (under `CBAdvertisementDataServiceUUIDsKey`):
     - Must contain all of the elements in `requiredAdvertisedServiceUUIDs`.
     - Must not contain any of the elements in `forbiddenAdvertisedServiceUUIDs`.
 - `advertisementFilter(peripheral:advertisementData:)` must return true.

 After selecting a `DiscoveredDevice` to connect to, we attempt to instantiate the `Device` type. The list of matching `Device` types are iterated over in order. If the peripheral provides the services specified in `requiredServices`, we attempt to instantiate that `Device` type for this peripheral. We return the first successfully instantiated `Device` type.
