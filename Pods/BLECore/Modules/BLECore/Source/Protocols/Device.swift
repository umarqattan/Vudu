/**
 Instances of the `Device` protocol correspond to a particular type of device supported by an application. The BLECore library identifies a device based upon the values provided by the `identification` property. See `DeviceIdentification` for further details.

 A set of device types (i.e., types implementing the `Device` protocol) must be registered with the `BluetoothManager`. This is used to filter discovered devices allowing applications to consider only devices that provide the required services.

 During device discovery, only peripherals that match an `identification` object on a registered `Device` type are considered. See `DeviceInformation` for more details.

 When a session is opened with a peripheral, an instance of the matching device type (i.e., the type implementing the `Device` protocol) is created.
