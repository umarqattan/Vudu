/**
 A session represents the communication between this device and a remote peripheral. It must be opened (via the `open()` function) to initiate a connection. It must be closed (via the `close()` function) to tear down the connection. It must be disposed (via the `dispose()` function) to remove it from the `BluetoothManager` that created it, allowing it to be deallocated.

  The session object is responsible for routing CoreBluetooth events coming in to the peripheral (via the `CBPeripheralDelegate` protocol) to the appropriate service on the device.

 Calling `open()` on a session begins the connection process. This is a multi-step process that ends successfully with an instantiated `Device` object and an open communication channel. The process is as follows:

 - `open()` calls `CBCentralManager.connect(_:options:)`, passing the peripheral provided to the session initializer.
 - If the connection was successful (the `BluetoothManager` received a call to `CBCentralManagerDelegate.centralManager(_:didConnect:)` indicating a successful connection), we begin discovering services on the peripheral (via `CBPeripheral.discoverServices(_:)`).
 - After services are discovered (the session received a call to `CBPeripheralDelegate.peripheral(_:error:)` indicating success), we begin discovering characteristics for the discovered services.
 - After all characteristics are discovered (the session received calls to `CBPeripheralDelegate.peripheral(_:service:error:)` indicating success), we attempt to instantiate a matching `Device` type by calling `BluetoothManager.instantiateDevice(for:)`.
 - If a matching `Device` type is found and successfully instantiated, the session was successfully opened and the `SessionDelegate` is notified.
 - If any of the steps above fail, the `SessionDelegate` is notified.
