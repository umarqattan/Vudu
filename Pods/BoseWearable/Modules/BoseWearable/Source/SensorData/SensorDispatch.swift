/**
 A `SensorDispatch` object is used to receive sensor readings. A `SensorDispatch` object listens for the underlying `WearableDeviceEvent` notifications indicating that sensor data has been received. It then unpacks the individual values from the data and dispatches each to its appropriate callback block and to its handler (a `SensorDispatchHandler` object).

 An app can have arbitrarily many `SensorDispatch` objects. This allows multiple handlers inside an app all to listen to the same sensor. Each `SensorDispatch` automatically registers and deregisters for the appropriate `WearableDeviceEvent` notifications.

 A `SensorDispatch` object is created with an associated `OperationQueue`. Specifying the `.main` queue is suitable for when the app's user interface should be updated in response to the event. Otherwise, a background `OperationQueue` can be provided.

 When a `WearableDeviceEvent.didReceiveSensorData(SensorData)` notification is received, the `SensorDispatch` object does the following on the `OperationQueue` provided to the `SensorDispatch` initializer:

 - Dispatches the `SensorData` object to `sensorDataCallback` and to `SensorDispatchHandler.receivedSensorData(_:)`.
 - Each of the values in the `SensorData` object is dispatched to the appropriate handler:
    - Accelerometer values are dispatched to `accelerometerCallback` and to  `SensorDispatchHandler.receivedAccelerometer(vector:accuracy:timestamp:)`
    - Gyroscope values are dispatched to `gyroscopeCallback` and to  `SensorDispatchHandler.receivedGyroscope(vector:accuracy:timestamp:)`
    - Rotation values are dispatched to `rotationCallback` and to `SensorDispatchHandler.receivedRotation(quaternion:accuracy:timestamp:)`.
    - Game rotation values are dispatched to `gameRotationCallback` and to `SensorDispatchHandler.receivedGameRotation(quaternion:timestamp:)`.
    - Orientation values are dispatched to `orientationCallback` and to  `SensorDispatchHandler.receivedOrientation(vector:accuracy:timestamp:)`
    - Magnetometer values are dispatched to `magnetometerCallback` and to  `SensorDispatchHandler.receivedMagnetometer(vector:accuracy:timestamp:)`
    - Uncalibrated magnetometer values are dispatched to `uncalibratedMagnetometerCallback` and to  `SensorDispatchHandler.receivedUncalibratedMagnetometer(vector:bias:timestamp:)`

 Callbacks are only invoked if they are non-nil. Thus you need only provide callback blocks for sensors you are interested in. Similarly, the `SensorDispatchHandler` protocol provides default implementation of all of its handler functions. Thus you need only provide implementations for sensors you are interested in. A `SensorDispatchHandler` and callback blocks can co-exist. Each callback is invoked before the corresponding `SensorDispatchHandler` function.
