     Configure the sensors on a wearable device. The caller provides a block to this function that takes a `SensorConfiguration` value. The current `SensorConfiguration` is passed to the block which is executed synchronously on the calling thread. That `SensorConfiguration` value can be modified to match the desired configuration. Once the block returns, that updated configuration is then sent to the wearable device (via `WearableDevice.changeSensorConfiguration(_:)`).

     If the remote device accepts the new configuration, the `sensorConfiguration` property is updated. If the remote device rejects the new configuration, a `WearableDeviceEvent.didFailToWriteSensorConfiguration(Error)` event is fired.

     For example, to enable the accelerometer and gyroscope at 50 Hz (20 ms update period):

     ```
     device.configureSensors { config in
         // Reset the configuration so all other sensors are disabled.
         config.disableAll()

         // Enable the desired sensors.
         config.enable(.accelerometer, at: ._20ms)
         config.enable(.gyroscope, at: ._20ms)
     }
