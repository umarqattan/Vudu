     Registers a handler block to be executed on the specified queue whenever a `WearableDeviceEvent` is posted from this `WearableDevice` object.

     Note that the returned `ListenerToken` must be retained. Once it is deallocated, the listener is deregistered.

     If the closure passed to this function references `self`, you must add `[weak self]` to the closure's capture list. Failing to do so will result in a retain cycle and leaked memory.

     - parameter queue: The queue on which to execute the block. If you pass `nil`, the block is run synchronously on the posting thread.
     - parameter handler: The block to be executed when the event is received.
     - returns: An opaque `ListenerToken` object. The listener is automatically deregistered when this token object is deallocated, so be sure to retain a reference to it.
