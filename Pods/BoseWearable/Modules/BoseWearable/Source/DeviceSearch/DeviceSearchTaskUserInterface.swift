 Objects conforming to this protocol provide a user interface to show devices as they are discovered and allow the user to select a device.

 A `DeviceSearchTask` is initialized with an object conforming to the `DeviceSearchTaskUserInterface` protocol and calls these functions to show, hide, and update the user interface. The user interface calls back to the device search task via the `DeviceSearchTaskUserInterfaceDelegate` protocol.
