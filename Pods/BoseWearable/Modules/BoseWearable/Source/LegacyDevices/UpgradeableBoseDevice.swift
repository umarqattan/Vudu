/**
 Represents a Bose device that, based upon the product ID provided in the advertisement data, requires a firmware update in order to support connections from the Bose Wearable SDK.

 Note that this class does not need to implement `WearableDevice`. Since no connection to the device is needed to make the determination that a firmware upgrade is needed (all necessary information is contained in the advertisement), we can simply throw the appropriate error in the initializer. This will cause the connection to fail before it is even opened.
