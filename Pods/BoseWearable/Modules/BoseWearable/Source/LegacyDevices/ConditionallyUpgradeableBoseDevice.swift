/**
 Represents a Bose device that possibly could support connections from the Bose Wearable SDK. The product ID provided in the advertisement data suggests that this device may be supported. However, we need to connect to the device and query the serial number provided by the Device Information Service. If the serial number indicates this product can be supported with a firmware upgrade, we raise an error indicating this. If the serial number indicates this product cannot be supported even with a firmware upgrade, we raise an error indicating it is an unsupported device.

 Note that this class must implement `WearableDevice` as it needs to have a RemoteWearableDeviceSession associated with it. We establish a connection, retrieve the serial number from the Device Information Service, and then we raise an error indicating whether this device could be supported with a firmware upgrade or that the device is unsupported. This is done via the `WearableDevice.receivedAllStartupInformation()` function.
